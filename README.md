## What is Madata?

Ever noticed how it's relatively easy to build a client-side JS app,
but once you need to persist data remotely, things get complicated?
Madata bridges that gap, by providing a **unified API for authentication, reading & storing data, as well as file uploads**,
for a number of [supported cloud services](/backends/).
Using Madata, you can develop apps with user accounts and remote storage and host them anywhere that supports hosting static assets.
And what's better, it’s completely **free and open source**!
Madata is an evolution of the storage component of our language [Mavo](https://mavo.io/),
as we got many requests from developers who wanted to use it without the rest of Mavo.

Madata works in the browser, as well as in NodeJS.
In Node, it requires version 18.7 or higher.

<div class="warning">

**Here be dragons** Madata has not yet been officially released, we are trying a “soft launch” first.
It is currently in pre-alpha and very much a work in progress.
Its API may change. It may have bugs.
Please try it out, and [open issues](https://github.com/madatajs/madata/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) as you find them!
Pull requests are welcome too :)

</div>

## Getting Started

While you can [install Madata via npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/madata), you can also
just use it directly from the CDN (provided by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)):

```js
// Import Madata and all supported backends
import Backend from "https://madata.dev/src/index.js";
```

You then create a `Backend` object by passing a URL to `Backend.from()`:

```js
let backend = Backend.from("https://github.com/leaverou/repo/data.json");
```

You can now call methods like…
- `backend.load()` to read data
- `backend.login()` to authenticate the user
- `backend.logout()` to log the user out
- `backend.store()` to store data
- `backend.upload()` to upload files

These methods are identical for all backends that support them.
This means you can swap one backend for another without having to change your code,
just by changing a URL!

Here is a full example that provides a very bare-bones authentication UI,
reads an object from a JSON file on GitHub,
provides UI for editing the data,
and saves back.

<div class="warning">

This example uses inline event handlers and global variables to keep the code short,
don’t do that in production. :)

</div>

```html
<span id=myUsername></span>
<button id=loginButton onclick="backend.login()">Login</button>
<button id=logoutButton onclick="backend.logout()" hidden>Logout</button>

Value: <input id="valueInput" oninput="json.value = this.value">
<button id=saveButton onclick="backend.store(json)">Save</button>

<script type=module>
import Backend from "https://madata.dev/src/index.js";

globalThis.backend = Backend.from("https://github.com/leaverou/repo/data.json");

backend.addEventListener("mv-login", evt => {
	loginButton.hidden = true;
	myUsername.textContent = backend.user.username;
});

backend.addEventListener("mv-logout", evt => {
	logoutButton.hidden = true;
	myUsername.textContent = "";
});

globalThis.json = (await backend.load()) ?? {value: 0};
valueInput.value = json.value;
</script>
```



<!-- {{ ("--" + ">") | safe }}
{% set backendSummary %}
{% include 'backends/README.md' %}
{% endset %}
{{ backendSummary | md | safe }}
</div>
{{ ("<!" + "--") | safe }} -->
<div class="gh-only">

## Supported backends

Visit [the backends page](/backends/) for the full list.

</div>

## Authentication

- `backend.login()` shows authentication UI
- `backend.login({passive: true})` tries to authenticate the user silently (i.e. if they are already logged in)
It is called automatically when you call `backend.load()` or `backend.store()`.
- `backend.logout()` logs the user out
- `mv-login` and `mv-logout` events are fired on the `Backend` object when the user logs in or out

Read more about [authentication](/docs/authentication/)

## Storage

Save:

```js
let fileInfo = await backend.store(json);
```

## Uploads

For backends that support uploads, this is how simple it could be to create an image uploader:
<p hidden class="demo-ignore"></p>

```html
<input type=file id=uploader>
```

```js
uploadForm.addEventListener("submit", evt => {
	evt.preventDefault();

	let file = uploader.files[0];

	if (file && file.type.startsWith("image/")) {
		backend.upload(file, `images/${file.name}`);
	}
});
```

You can check if `backend.upload` is defined to see if the backend supports image uploads.
