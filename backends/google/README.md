# Google backends

There are three backends here, all using authentication via Google:

- [Google Calendar](calendar/)
- [Google Drive](drive/)
- [Google Sheets](sheets/)

<div class=note>

The Google backends supported by Madata comply with the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the Limited Use requirements, to the extent that this can be guaranteed by Madata. Madata users should also be mindful of and follow these policies.

<div class=warning>

Google has not yet verified the apps for the official Madata auth provider,
so the login experience works, but shows a warning about the app being unverified.
If this is an issue for your use case, you can use an [alternative auth provider](/docs/authentication/) meanwhile.
