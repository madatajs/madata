# Google backends

There are four backends here, all using authentication via Google:

- [Google Calendar](calendar/)
- [Google Drive](drive/)
- [Google Firebase](firebase/)
- [Google Sheets](sheets/)

<div class=warning>

Google has not yet verified the apps for the official Madata auth provider,
so the login experience works, but shows a warning about the app being unverified.
If this is an issue for your use case, you can use an [alternative auth provider](/docs/authentication/) meanwhile.
